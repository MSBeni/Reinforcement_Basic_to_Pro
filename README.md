# RL_single_Multi_Agent_codes
A repository to check for some funny algorithms in RL

Checking for basic to advanced RL algorithms and useful platform
Algorithms like: MonteCarlo, Dynamic_Programming, Temporal Difference, Model approximation, Policy Gradient, Deep Q-Network, A3C and Multi_Model RL platforms

Many different enviroment are also modeled or discussed based on this algorithms, from gym basic single agent envs like mountain_car to the some more complicated Universe models and also some self defined multi agent platform
